The two Python files correspond to the two projects done during the course. 
1. ```incomp_euler.py``` corresponds to Project 1. Its results are in ```P1_report.pdf```.
2. ```euler.py``` corresponds to Project 2. Its results are in ```P2_report.pdf```

The problem statements have been added (as separate PDF files) to the repository with self-explanatory filenames.
